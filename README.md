# Water_Quality


Welcome to my Github. For this project, I worked with two other individuals, Hervin and Naa. Our objective of this analysis was to extract insights from these datasets to determine the water quality of countries that have the highest import of textiles to the United States.

Additional Datasets used:
Available on Kaggle under, India's Water Quality
IndiaAffectedWaterQualityAreas (Too large to import)
